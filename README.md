# cursor-vip

> 🌐️ English | [中文](README_CN.md)

⚠️ If your region supports official cursor payment, please support the official purchase as much as your funds allow, cursor is a good editor.

⚠️ This project is only to provide a solution for inconvenient payment areas. Currently, every 8 devices share a Pro account, and the Pro account is purchased with our money. Do not abuse it, thank you!

⚠️ The cost and benefits generated by using this project are the same as the official ones. This project is not cheaper. It just feels less expensive because it is shared by 8 people. However, the stability and speed are not as good as the official ones.

⚠️ The stability of the proxy mode is better than the normal mode. If the resources are used up in the proxy mode, please open a new session.

⚠️ We plan to cooperate with the cursor official in the future to provide support for projects that can promote the progress of world civilization.
